        <div style="background-color: rgb(65, 63, 63);">Here are some random and fun facts about developers:  

             General Developer Facts:  <br>
            1. Coffee is Fuel:** A 2021 survey by JetBrains found that over 50% of developers drink coffee while coding. Some developers claim they write better code with caffeine!  <br>
            2. Preferred Operating Systems:** Many developers favor Linux for coding, especially backend developers, because of its flexibility and powerful tools.  <br>
            3. **Fastest-Growing Languages:** Python has been consistently one of the fastest-growing programming languages due to its simplicity and applications in data science, AI, and web development.<br  
            4. **Debugging Time:** Developers spend about 50% of their time debugging or fixing errors rather than writing new code. <br> 
            5. **Favorite Keyboard Shortcut:** Ctrl + Z (or Cmd + Z on Mac) might be the most-used shortcut among developers. Undo is a lifesaver!  <br>
            
             Historical Facts:  <br>
            6. **First Programmer:** Ada Lovelace is considered the first programmer. She worked on Charles Babbage‚Äôs Analytical Engine in the 1840s.  <br>
            7. **Oldest Programming Language:** Fortran, created in the 1950s, is one of the oldest programming languages still in use today. It‚Äôs especially common in scientific computing.<br>  
            
             Fun Developer Stereotypes (With a Grain of Truth!): <br 
            8. **Dark Mode Fanatics:** Many developers love dark mode for their IDEs, claiming it‚Äôs easier on the eyes.  <br>
            9. **Hoodie Uniforms:** Silicon Valley culture popularized hoodies as a stereotype for developers, thanks in part to Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs style.  <br>
            10. **Stack Overflow Dependency:** Many developers jokingly admit they "code with Stack Overflow open," using it as a lifeline for solving tricky problems.  <br>
            
            Miscellaneous Developer Tidbits:  <br>
            11. **Keyboard Wizards:** Developers often type faster than the average person, clocking in at over 60-80 words per minute. <br> 
            12. **Bug Origins:** The term ‚Äúbug‚Äù in programming comes from an actual moth found in Harvard‚Äôs Mark II computer in 1947.<br>  
            13. **Side Projects:** A large number of developers have side projects, which are sometimes more exciting to them than their day jobs.<br>  
            14. **GitHub Galactic:** GitHub's Octocat mascot has made it to space! NASA uses GitHub for open-source projects and data sharing.  <br>
            15. **AI as a Coding Assistant:** Modern developers are increasingly using AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot to write and debug code. <br>
